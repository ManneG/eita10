#
# A combination of two things makes this much more complicated than it should have to be:
#
#  1. The standard Python interpreter allows threading but has a global lock
#     preventing more than one thread at a time from executing Python code, called the
#     Global Interpreter Lock, GIL. Many libraries like Nympy and blocking IO operations
#     will release the lock when running time consuming operations so that theading still
#     works. However, some things, specifically including drawing a Matplotlib plot with 
#     a complex waveform, is done in Python code and may lock up the interpreter for a
#     long time.
#
#  2. The callback used by the sounddevice library (which is really just a wrapper around
#     the C portaudio library) will time out and loose data if the interpreter is locked
#     for a long time (not exactly sure but something like a couple of 100 ms seems enough)
#     when the callback should be executed. There are no exceptions, the overflow flag is
#     not set, the callback just magically does not happen and data is lost.
#
# The only fix means not using threads but a completely separate OS process running its
# own interpreter. This opens up a whole can of worms related to shared data, and it
# works differently for different OS:es. The overall wisdom from the internet seems to
# be that if it works on Windows it works on Linux and MacOS too. So here we go, this 
# works on Windows, and the complexity is hidden in here. May the Universe forgive us.
